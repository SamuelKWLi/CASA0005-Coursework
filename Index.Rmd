# Aim: 
To identify spatial patterns in NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations within London and identifying possible controlling factors that could explain its distribution.

# Research Questions:
1.	What spatial patterns are there for the spatial distribution of NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations are the MSOA scale within London?
2.	What spatial patterns are there for the spatial distribution of schools, GPs and hospitals that exceed the WHO air pollution guidelines within London?
3.	What controlling factors influence the spatial patterns in NO2 and PM2.5 concentration at the MSOA scale within London?
