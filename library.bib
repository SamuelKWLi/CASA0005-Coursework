abstract = {We consider spatio-temporal interpolation of geographic data using both the reduction method, which treats time as an independent dimension, and the extension method, which treats time as equivalent to a spatial dimension. We adopt both 2-D and 3-D shape functions from finite element methods for the spatio-temporal interpolation of 2-D spatial and 1-D temporal data sets. We also develop new 4-D shape functions and use them for the spatio-temporal interpolation of 3-D spatial and 1-D temporal data sets. Using an actual real estate data set with house prices, we compare these methods with other spatio-temporal interpolation methods based on inverse distance weighting and kriging. The comparison criteria include interpolation accuracy, error-proneness to time aggregation, invariance to scaling on the coordinate axes, and the type of constraints used in the representation of the interpolated data. Our experimental results show that the extension method based on shape functions is the most accurate and the overall best spatio-temporal interpolation method. New color rendering algorithms are also developed for the visualization of time slices of the interpolated spatio-temporal data. We show some visualization results of the real estate data set including the vertical profile of house prices. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Law2017,
abstract = {An under-explored topic within the field of planning and housing studies is related to the definition of local area unit. An empirical problem that arises is that different types of local area units can infer different results. This could be in constructing segregation indices, in estimating hedonic price models or in identifying housing submarkets. This research proposes the concept of Street-based Local Area (SLA), in asking to what extent SLA associate with house price. In order to examine this question, this article borrows from network science and space syntax research in defining SLA. This research conjectures that SLA has a significant effect on house price and that this effect is captured more strongly than ad-hoc administrative region-based local area. In order to test this conjecture, this research adopted the multi-level hedonic price approach to estimate local area effects on house prices for the case study of Metropolitan London in the United Kingdom. Results showed significant local area effects on house prices and that SLA is preferred to region-based one. The plausible reasons are firstly, people perceived the local area on a street network. Street-based Local Area is able to capture more precisely subtle perceptual differences in an urban environment than an ad-hoc administrative region. Second, the topology of the street network reinforces the socio-economic similarity/differences overtime. Differences between local areas can become more pronounced as like-minded people bump into each other, cluster together and share information with each other. Third, as people identify these local areas they would make decisions based on it. The local area becomes part of the housing bundle leading to it having an effect on house price. The main contribution of the research is the novel application of community detection techniques on the street-network dual graph to defining SLA. This is important as it links the topology of the street network to how we define and perceive local area and it presents an alternative to ad-hoc administrative geographies that are currently applied in many aspects of neighbourhood planning.},

abstract = {Fine particulate matter {\textless}2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) air pollution is the most important environmental risk factor contributing to global cardiovascular (CV) mortality and disability. Short-term elevations in PM2.5 increase the relative risk of acute CV events by 1{\%} to 3{\%} within a few days. Longer-term exposures over several years increase this risk by a larger magnitude (∼10{\%}), which is partially attributable to the development of cardiometabolic conditions (e.g., hypertension and diabetes mellitus). As such, ambient PM2.5 poses a major threat to global public health. In this review, the authors provide an overview of air pollution and health, including assessment of exposure, impact on CV outcomes, mechanistic underpinnings, and impact of air pollution reduction strategies to mitigate CV risk. The review concludes with future challenges, including the inextricable link between air pollution and climate change, and calls for large-scale trials to allow the promulgation of formal evidence-based recommendations to lower air pollution–induced health risks.},

@article{Cames2013,
abstract = {Background: On the way to a more sustainable society, transport needs to be urgently optimized regarding energy consumption and pollution control. While in earlier decades, Europe followed automobile technology leaps initiated in the USA, it has decoupled itself for 20 years by focusing research capacity towards the diesel powertrain. The resulting technology shift has led to some 45 million extra diesel cars in Europe. Its outcome in terms of health and environmental effects will be investigated below. Results: Expected greenhouse gas savings initiated by the shift to diesel cars have been overestimated. Only about one tenth of overall energy efficiency improvements of passenger cars can be attributed to it. These minor savings are on the other hand overcompensated by a significant increase of supply chain CO2 emissions and extensive black carbon emissions of diesel cars without particulate filter. We conclude that the European diesel car boom did not cool down the atmosphere. Moreover, toxic NOx emissions of diesel cars have been underestimated up to 20-fold in officially announced data. The voluntary agreement signed in 1998 between the European Automobile industry and the European Commission envisaging to reduce CO2 emissions has been identified as elementary for the ensuing European diesel car boom. Four factors have been quantified in order to explain very different dieselization rates across Europe: impact of national car/supplier industry, ecological modernization, fuel tourism and corporatist political governance. By comparing the European diesel strategy to the Japanese petrol-hybrid avenue, it becomes clear that a different road would have both more effectively reduced CO2 emissions and pollutants. Conclusion: Europe's car fleets have been persistently transformed from being petrol-driven to diesel-driven over the last 20 years. This paper investigates on how this came to be and why Europe took a distinct route as compared to other parts of the world. It also attempts to evaluate the outcome of stated goals of this transformation which was primarily a robust reduction in GHG emissions. We conclude that global warming has been negatively affected, and air pollution has become alarming in many European locations. More progressive development scenarios could have prevented these outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Cames and Helmers; licensee Springer.},

@article{Kraak2003,
abstract = {In recent years, the visualization of geospatial data has undergone dramatic and important developments. Next to static maps, nowadays, immersive and highly interactive virtual environments can be used to explore and present dynamic geospatial data. Additionally, the World Wide Web has developed into a prominent medium to disseminate geospatial data and maps. In visualizing geospatial data, methods and techniques from fields, such as scientific visualization and information visualization, are applied because of the large volumes of data at hand. This has accumulated in what is known as geovisualization - the use of visual geospatial displays to explore data and through that exploration to generate hypotheses, develop problem solutions and construct knowledge. Maps and other linked graphics play a key role in this process. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the usefulness of geovisualization and, in particular, how alternative graphic representations can stimulate the visual thought process. This is demonstrated by applying geovisualization techniques to Minard's well-known map of Napoleon's 1812 campaign into Russia, the "Carte figurative des pertes successives en hommes de l'Armee Fran{\c{c}}aise dans la campagne de Russie 1812-1813" (http://www.itc.nl/personal/kraak/1812/). {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Motor vehicles emit a cocktail of pollutants and are a major contributor to ground-level air pollution, but little is known regarding the ecological impacts of air pollution from roads on the surrounding vegetation. Data are presented on vegetation at three sites adjacent to two major motorways in the UK, comprising two woodland sites and one blanket bog site. Surveys of oak and beech tree health (at the woodland sites) and species composition (at the blanket bog site) were undertaken along transects away from the motorway. The oak tree health survey found increased defoliation and insect damage near to the motorway, and the beech tree health survey also found poorer crown condition close to the motorway. Vascular species composition showed a trend towards species adapted to higher N availability close to the motorway, while the moss Polytrichum commune showed a significant decline in frequency with distance from the motorway. The effect of the road was estimated to extend to approximately 100 m at these three sites; this distance was consistent with the measured profile of NO2, which declined to background levels at about 100 m. The results suggest that emissions of air pollutants can have significant ecological impacts on sensitive sites within 100 m of major roads. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper offers new insight into the monetary value of green space at the intra-urban level. To this end, an established monetary valuation method, hedonic price analysis, is integrated with a relatively novel non-monetary valuation method. In specific, online value mapping-based survey data (N = 723) are used to inform hedonic models of the preferences that potential home buyers may have for nearby attractive green spaces. The estimation uses data on 35,298 home transactions in the Amsterdam agglomeration's urban core. Homes nearby attractive green space are found to sell at a price premium, which decays with distance and becomes negligible after one kilometer. The estimated price-effect varies from 7.1{\%}–9.3{\%} for houses within 0.25 km from the nearest attractive green space to 1.7{\%}–2.3{\%} for houses located at 0.75–1.0 km away, depending on the scale at which omitted spatial variables are controlled for. Adding to the discussion of spatial controls in this type of analysis, the controls are evaluated at multiple scales and a metric that simplifies the interpretation of the scale of spatial controls – the mean equalized diameter – is introduced. This study's findings may inform policymakers who seek to maximize the well-being of urban citizens through public investments in attractive amenities.},

@article{Crespo2013,
abstract = {Hedonic house-price models have long been used in urban studies to investigate important factors characterizing cities (eg, the demand for amenities or housing submarkets). Traditionally, the formulation of hedonic models has been solved using global spatial econometric techniques. The development of local regression methods brought new insights into urban planning as the relationships between house prices and their determinants can be estimated locally and therefore mapped across space. Such maps provide planners and policy makers with valuable location-specific information to support their decision-making processes. A feature that is frequently overlooked when performing spatial local analysis is testing the statistical significance of local parameter estimates over space. This can be done by mapping the t-value of parameter estimates (t-surfaces). In this study we propose the use of a mixed geographically weighted regression (mixed-GWR) technique to estimate a hedonic house-price model in Zurich. Mixed-GWR is an extended version of GWR by which some parameters are allowed to vary over space, while others remained fixed. To obtain spatially explicit results in a more meaningful way, we propose the use of t-surfaces to explore the statistical significance of selected local parameter estimates over space. We also follow the Bonferroni correction to overcome the problem of multiple hypothesis testing in local regression modelling. Results reveal interesting patterns in the spatial variability of local estimates for planners. For instance, areas are identified over which public policies such as house taxing have little or no effect on house pricing. Similarly, economic distortions in the housing market can be examined through the variability of residents' willingness to pay for larger dwellings. Also, urban development processes such as densification of cities can be supported by spatially exploring relevant socioeconomic variables. {\textcopyright}2013 Pion and its Licensors.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose a categorization of green space into eight different types and quantify their impact on housing prices in the city of Aalborg using the hedonic house price method. The categorization was made manually according to an idealized description of the eight types of green space and a rating system in which each green space was rated according to accessibility, maintenance levels and neighboring negative land-use. The hedonic house price schedule for each of the green spaces was estimated using a generalized additive model, which allows for a data driven adjustment of underlying omitted spatial processes. To our knowledge the use of a spatial generalized additive model is novel to the hedonic valuation literature. We find that types of green space, which are rated highly in terms of accessibility and maintenance level, have high implicit prices whereas types with low ratings are not identified or provide ambiguous results. Green space buffering unattractive land-use such as infrastructure and industry is found to provide negative implicit prices despite controlling for the negative neighboring land-use. Our results clearly indicate that green space is not a uniform environmental amenity but rather a set of distinct goods with very different impacts on the housing price. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In developed nations people spend about 90{\%} of their time indoors. The relationship between indoor and outdoor air pollution levels is important for the understanding of the health effects of outdoor air pollution. Although other studies describe both the outdoor and indoor atmospheric environment, few excluded a priori major indoor sources, measured the air exchange rate, included more than one micro-environment and included the presence of human activity. PM2.5, soot, NO2 and the air exchange rate were measured during winter and summer indoors and outdoors at 18 homes (mostly apartments) of 18 children (6-11-years-old) and also at the six schools and 10 pre-schools that the children attended. The three types of indoor environments were free of environmental tobacco smoke and gas appliances, as the aim was to asses to what extent PM2.5, soot and NO2 infiltrate from outdoors to indoors. The median indoor and outdoor PM2.5 levels were 8.4 $\mu$g m-3 and 9.3 $\mu$g m-3, respectively. The median indoor levels for soot and NO2 were 0.66 m-1 × 10-5 and 10.0 $\mu$g m-3, respectively. The respective outdoor levels were 0.96 m-1 × 10-5 and 12.4 $\mu$g m-3. The median indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratios were 0.93, 0.76 and 0.92 for PM2.5, soot and NO2, respectively. Their infiltration factors were influenced by the micro-environment, ventilation type and air exchange rate, with aggregated values of 0.25, 0.55 and 0.64, respectively. Indoor and outdoor NO2 levels were strongly associated (R2 = 0.71), followed by soot (R2 = 0.50) and PM2.5 (R2 = 0.16). In Stockholm, the three major indoor environments occupied by children offer little protection against combustion-related particles and gases in the outdoor air. Outdoor PM2.5 seems to infiltrate less, but indoor sources compensate. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@techreport{COMEAP2010,
abstract = {That air pollution impacts on health is in no doubt and indeed has been the driver for improvements in air quality worldwide. The size of this impact has, however, been more difficult to determine, the issue being complex and attended by degrees of uncertainty. Total mortality is the easiest endpoint to tackle, cause-specific mortality less so and morbidity (hospital admissions, symptoms and so on), frankly, difficult. COMEAP led the field in attempting to quantify the size of the health impact of air pollution with its first quantification report in 1998, limited though it was to quantifying the effects of short-term exposures to particles, sulphur dioxide and ozone on mortality and hospital admissions. At that stage we did not have sufficient information on the impact of long-term exposures to be able to quantify for the UK what we suspected to be a likely greater effect with any degree of certainty. Over the last three years COMEAP has again been grappling with this area, this time addressing the impact of longer term exposures. In 2009 COMEAP produced a report on the effects of long-term exposures on mortality which recommended that formal quantification of the effects of such long-term exposures should be undertaken. Over the last decade, other groups and researchers have attempted to do this both in terms of ‘impact' and ‘burden' reporting differing results. One of the reasons for these apparent differences is the way in which these effects are expressed and this has been a focus of this current insightful and challenging report, which addresses these issues in detail. The report more than matches earlier COMEAP reports in terms of its ability and willingness to tackle difficult areas and to move thinking forward rather than simply reiterating what is already known. As a consequence, I believe that this report will not only generate interest and stimulate discussion in the short term but will be used in the longer term as a starting point for further research and as a guide to policy development. Any report such as this represents many months of work; this is no exception. I am particularly grateful to Fintan Hurley for leading on this with such rigour and energy and to the Secretariat and Members of COMEAP, and the QUARK II subgroup of COMEAP, who have contributed their time so generously. This is the work of a truly independent, truly expert group and a remarkable example of all that is good in providing scientific advice to Government. I look forward to seeing how this is received and how the report itself impacts on policy development and consequent cleaner air in the UK.},

Computer simulations with local environmental data reveal that trees and forests in the conterminous United States removed 17.4 million tonnes (t) of air pollution in 2010 (range: 9.0-23.2 million t), with human health effects valued at 6.8 billion U.S. dollars (range: {\$}1.5-13.0 billion).

Most of the pollution removal occurred in rural areas, while most of the health impacts and values were within urban areas.

Public health insurance claims, hospital admission rates for cardiac and respiratory disease, pneumonia cases, mortality records, influenza reports, temperature, and air pollutant concentrations are analyzed for December–February 1952–1953 and compared with those for the previous year or years. Mortality rates for the smog episode from December 1952 to February 1953 were 50–300{\%} higher than the previous year. Claims that the smog only elevated health risks during and immediately following the peak fog 5–9 December 1952 and that an influenza epidemic accounted fully for persisting mortality increases in the first 2 months of 1953 are rejected. We estimate about 12,000 excess deaths occurred from December 1952 through February 1953 because of acute and persisting effects of the 1952 London smog. Pollution levels during the London smog were 5–19 times above current regulatory standards and guidelines and approximate current levels in some rapidly developing regions.

abstract = {In the present study, to understand the spatial distribution characteristics of the ETo over India, spatial interpolation was performed on the means of 32 years (1971–2002) monthly data of 131 India Meteorological Department stations uniformly distributed over the country by two methods, namely, inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation and kriging. Kriging was found to be better while developing the monthly surfaces during cross-validation. However, in station-wise validation, IDW performed better than kriging in almost all the cases, hence is recommended for spatial interpolation of ETo and its governing meteorological parameters. This study also checked if direct kriging of FAO-56 Penman–Monteith (PM) (Allen et al. in Crop evapotranspiration—guidelines for computing crop water requirements, Irrigation and drainage paper 56, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Rome, 1998) point ETo produced comparable results against ETo estimated with individually kriged weather parameters (indirect kriging). Indirect kriging performed marginally well compared to direct kriging. Point ETo values were extended to areal ETo values by IDW and FAO-56 PM mean ETo maps for India were developed to obtain sufficiently accurate ETo estimates at unknown locations.},

We identified 108 papers published after 1995 and summarized the scientific evidence regarding effect modification of associations between short-term exposure to particulate matter and the risk of death or hospitalization. We performed a meta-analysis of estimated mortality associations by age and sex. We found strong, consistent evidence that the elderly experience higher risk of particular matter--associated hospitalization and death, weak evidence that women have higher risks of hospitalization and death, and suggestive evidence that those with lower education, income, or employment status have higher risk of death. Meta-analysis showed a statistically higher risk of death of 0.64{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.50, 0.78) for older populations compared with 0.34{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.25, 0.42) for younger populations per 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤10 $\mu$m. Women had a slightly higher risk of death of 0.55{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.41, 0.70) compared with 0.50{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.34, 0.54) for men, but these 2 risks were not statistically different. Our synthesis on modifiers for risks associated with particulate matter can aid the design of air quality policies and suggest directions for future research. Studies of biological mechanisms could be informed by evidence of differential risks by population, such as by sex and preexisting conditions.},

Korean households' expenditure pattern for private tutoring has been revealed through various surveys, but their demand for public school education has been rarely analyzed. Using the Housing Market Survey on the Seoul metropolitan area in 2001, this study estimates the household-level demand function for public school quality by applying a rigorous economic analysis model (Rosen's two-step estimation scheme). In the first step, this study estimated the impact of public school quality on house prices using the hedonic price function. This estimate can then be used as the implicit price for public school quality. Based on this, the study next estimated the household-level demand function for public school quality. Results showed that public school quality, as measured by the number of students per 1,000 graduates who entered Seoul National University, has a significant impact on house prices in the Seoul metropolitan area. The demand function estimation showed that the implicit price of school quality, household income and household head's educational attainment are the significant factors that determine parental demand for good schools. In particular, a 10{\%} increase in household income level results in attendance at a school that has 0.235 more students accepted by Seoul National University per 1,000 graduates, all other factors remaining constant. {\textcopyright} Korean Educational Development Institute 2013.},

abstract = {1. COMEAP's statement on the health effects of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) concluded that evidence associating NO 2 with health effects has strengthened substantially in recent years (COMEAP, 2015a). This increase in evidence has led to interest in estimating the mortality effects associated with long-term average concentrations of NO 2 . 2. We are currently considering how to quantify this association. We have provided interim recommendations to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), and are now exploring approaches to refining our advice. This statement explains how our thinking is developing. 3. We are carrying out a systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological studies of long-term average concentrations of NO 2 and all-cause mortality to derive a new single-pollutant model summary estimate for all-cause mortality. So far this is similar to the single-pollutant model summary estimate recommended in our letter to Defra of 24 July 2015 (Appendix 1), although there remain further studies to check and incorporate. We are also making a detailed appraisal of the results of the small number of two-and three-pollutant models that include NO 2 . 4. Further analysis to date has suggested that within the limited number of individual epidemiological studies that examine the effects of long-term exposure to both NO 2 and PM 2.5 , the combined effect of NO 2 and PM 2.5 estimated using coefficients where each is adjusted for the effects of the other, is either similar to or only a little higher than what would be estimated for either PM 2.5 or NO 2 alone, using unadjusted single-pollutant coefficients. This suggests that using a single-pollutant coefficient for NO 2 and a single-pollutant coefficient for PM 2.5 , and adding the results, would give an overestimate of the combined effects of the two pollutants. 5. We are considering a number of scientific and methodological challenges in interpreting the extent of the independence of the associations of mortality with concentrations of NO 2 and PM 2.5 . In addition, before producing final recommendations, further work is required on the influence of the spatial scale of modelled NO 2 2 concentrations and on a concentration cut-off for quantification. We have not yet completed our work on investigating and summarising the uncertainty around these and other issues. We intend to publish a report in the first half of 2016, once this additional work has been done. 6. In the meantime, we suggest use of the recommendations the working group made in July 2015, for cost-benefit analysis, with additional comment on the evidence in this statement that there is likely to be substantial overlap between NO 2 and PM 2.5 when single-pollutant models are used in the same analysis.

abstract = {One of the fundamental concepts necessary for the analysis of spatial data in a Geographic Information System (GIS) is a formal understanding of the geometric relationships among arbitrary spatial objects. Topological relations, a particular subset of geometric relations, are preserved under topological transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling. A comprehensive formal categorization of such binary topological relations between regions, lines, and points has been developed that is based upon the comparison of the nine intersections between the interiors, boundaries, and exteriors of the two objects. The basic criterion for the distinction of different topological relations is whether the intersections are empty or not, thus identifying 2 mutually exclusive topological relations. It is derived which of these 512 binary relations actually exist in IR between regions, lines, and points. An equivalent model is developed that replaces the intersections with exteriors by subset conditions of the closure so that efficient implementations of topological relations are possible in geographic information systems.},

abstract = {SYNONYMS GIS Buffers, Buffering Operations DEFINITION A buffer is a region of memory used to temporarily hold output or input data. In case of Geographical Information Systems, the units of buffering are points, lines, and polygons. Buffer operation refers the creation of a zone of a specified width around a point or a line or a polygon area. It is also referred to as a zone of specified distance around coverage features. There are two types of buffers: constant width buffers and variable width buffers. Both types can be generated for a set of coverage features based on each features attribute values. These zones or buffers can be used in queries to determine which entities occur either within or outside the defined buffer zone. Analogous to buffering in raster GIS is distance analysis. In practical situations, one needs to buffer multiple regions (points, lines and polygons) simultaneously. This gives rise to the idea of buffer allocation and replacement. Data movement happens by making use of primitive buffer operations such as point buffer operation, line buffer operation and polygon buffer operations. Buffer management involves the process of allocation of buffers and replacement of buffers when not needed. Several allocation policies and replacement policies that have been used in the context of memory buffers in computer science are directly applicable here.},

We model median house prices in 626 suburbs and achieve a high level of explanation . Distances from the CBD and from the coast are dominant factors in explaining house prices in Sydney . Predictably house and lot size are also highly significant factors . On the other hand a high propensity for violent crime significantly reduces property values . Over the whole city distance to rail station is not a statistically significant variable , but in suburb groups that are poorly served by other modes , median house prices fall significantly with increased distances to station . We found a similar but weaker result for access to high frequency buses . Contrary to expectation we found that higher density is marginally associated with higher median prices . However as the density variable is correlated (negatively) with median land area and , to a lesser extent , with distance to CBD , we would be cautious about concluding that density has no negative effect on house prices .},

abstract = {Transport poverty is an issue that has never fully captured the interests of the transport engineering profession in either the ‘global north' or ‘global south' and yet it is a problem that adversely affects the daily lives of millions of people across the globe. What precisely constitutes transport poverty is not adequately articulated within academic,policy or infrastructure design literature. This paper aims to demonstrate how the different ways that academic studies and policy programmes have defined and recorded the problem of transport poverty is directly related to the ways in which it has been subsequently addressed in practice. The overall impression is one of inadequacy,fragmentation,inconsistency and tokenistic treatment of an issue that potentially affects anywhere between 10 to 90{\%} of all households,depending on which definition is used and which country is being considered. This suggests that it is a far greater problem than the transport profession has previously been prepared to recognise and one that requires its urgent attention given the continuing trends for mass migration,urbanisation and wealth concentration within and between the ‘global north' and ‘global south'.},

The impact of transportation facilities is highly localized as well, and it is possible that spillover effects result from the capitalization of accessibility. The objective of this study was to review the theoretical background related to spatial hedonic models and the opportunities that they provided to evaluate the effect of new transportation infrastructure. An empirical case study is presented: the Madrid Metro Line 12, known as Metrosur, in the region of Madrid, Spain. The effect of proximity to metro stations on housing prices was evaluated. The analysis took into account a host of variables, including structure, location, and neighborhood and made use of three modeling approaches: linear regression estimation with ordinary least squares, spatial error, and spatial lag. The results indicated that better accessibility to Metrosur stations had a positive impact on real estate values and that the effect was marked in cases in which a house was for sale. The results also showed the presence of submarkets, which were well defined by geographic boundaries, and transport fares, which implied that the economic benefits differed across municipalities.},

abstract = {Accessibility is frequently used for measuring location in housing studies, but specifications of the measures differ greatly and its implications are hardly discussed. This paper sets out to systematically review accessibility measures that are used in hedonic price models (HPM), a method for estimating the implicit value of housing characteristics, such as location. From a systematic database search of peer-reviewed journal articles, we examined 54 articles that applies accessibility measures in hedonic price models that are based on three aspects of measure specification: type, impedance, and opportunities. We find that there are clear couplings between different impedances, types, and opportunities. We also noticed a tendency towards less advanced measurements, such as Euclidean distance and zonal measures, being used. Furthermore, we argue that these basic measures have a weaker connection to consumer perception, which is fundamental to the hedonic price approach. We also observed a lack of consideration to how this coupling between type, impedance, and opportunity could possibly affect the results. Theoretically, we can already conclude that some dominating impedances poorly relate to the fundamental theories of HPM, but this also points to the need for further research to empirically test the influence of the type-impedance-opportunity specification on the price estimates in HPM.},

This situation calls for a significant effort among the scientific community to come up with engaging and meaningful visualizations and accessible scenario simulation engines. The present paper gives a contribution in this direction by providing general methods to evaluate accessibility in cities based on public transportation data. Through the notion of isochrones, the accessibility quantities proposed measure the performance of transport systems at connecting places and people in urban systems. Then we introduce scores ranking cities according to their overall accessibility. We highlight significant inequalities in the distribution of these measures across the population, which are found to be strikingly similar across various urban environments. Our results are released through the interactive platform: www.citychrone.org, aimed at providing the community at large with a useful tool for awareness and decision-making.},

abstract = {With increasing evidence that exposures to air pollution near large roadways increases risks of a number of adverse human health effects, identifying methods to reduce these exposures has become a public health priority. Roadside vegetation barriers have shown the potential to reduce near-road air pollution concentrations; however, the characteristics of these barriers needed to ensure pollution reductions are not well understood. Designing vegetation barriers to mitigate near-road air pollution requires a mechanistic understanding of how barrier configurations affect the transport of traffic-related air pollutants. We first evaluated the performance of the Comprehensive Turbulent Aerosol Dynamics and Gas Chemistry (CTAG) model with Large Eddy Simulation (LES) to capture the effects of vegetation barriers on near-road air quality, compared against field data. Next, CTAG with LES was employed to explore the effects of six conceptual roadside vegetation/solid barrier configurations on near-road size-resolved particle concentrations, governed by dispersion and deposition. Two potentially viable design options are revealed: a) a wide vegetation barrier with high Leaf Area Density (LAD), and b) vegetation-solid barrier combinations, i.e., planting trees next to a solid barrier. Both designs reduce downwind particle concentrations significantly. The findings presented in the study will assist urban planning and forestry organizations with evaluating different green infrastructure design options.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of the paper is to verify whether the version of neighbourhoods created from the lowest geographical level improve a predictive accuracy of hedonic model in comparison with those based on upper geographical levels. Design/methodology/approach: The paper proposes a method for defining neighbourhoods using Thiessen polygons. The clustering technique is based on fuzzy equality. Clustering is started at different geographical levels: municipalities, traffic analysis zones, and apartment blocks' Thiessen polygons. Delineated neighbourhoods are incorporated into hedonic model of apartment prices, the applied methodologies are ordinary least squares and spatial error. Findings: With ordinary least squares regression, the slight superiority of Thiessen polygons is found in both in-sample analysis and ex-sample prediction. With spatial error technique, the clusters of Thiessen polygons do not always provide the best outcome, and their superiority is contested by the highest geographical level of municipalities. Research limitations/implications: This paper is the first attempt to apply the proposed method, which not always demonstrates clear superiority. In future study, the method of neighbourhood delineation could be used in combination with market segmentation. Practical implications: The proposal to use Thiessen polygons as a transition from points to continuous space can outline a base for the use of different clustering techniques, which are applicable to delineate neighbourhoods in housing market studies, in particular for the assessment purpose. The fuzzy equality clustering algorithm itself can be applied to polygonal data. Originality/value: The originality of the proposed method is that it defines neighbourhoods starting from individual observations applying fuzzy equality. Its advantages are an increased independence from existing boundaries, self-determination of a number of clusters, and total coverage of an area. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Generally, the Euclidean distance is the default metric for calibrating a GWR model in previous research and applications; however, it may not always be the most reasonable choice due to a partition by some natural or man-made features. Thus, we attempt to use a non-Euclidean distance metric in GWR. In this study, a GWR model is established to explore spatially varying relationships between house price and floor area with sampled house prices in London. To calibrate this GWR model, network distance is adopted. Compared with the other results from calibrations with Euclidean distance or adaptive kernels, the output using network distance with a fixed kernel makes a significant improvement, and the river Thames has a clear cut-off effect on the parameter estimations. {\textcopyright} 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Green sulfur bacteria possess a complex photosynthetic machinery. The dominant light harvesting systems are chlorosomes, which consist of bacteriochlorophyll c, d or e oligomers with small amounts of protein. The chlorosomes are energetically coupled to the membrane-embedded iron sulfur-type reaction center via a bacteriochlorophyll a-containing baseplate protein and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) antenna protein. The fluorescence yield and spectral properties of these photosynthetic complexes were investigated in intact cells of several species of green sulfur bacteria under physiological, anaerobic conditions. Surprisingly, green sulfur bacteria show a complex modulation of fluorescence yield upon illumination that is very similar to that observed in oxygenic phototrophs. Within a few seconds of illumination, the fluorescence reaches a maximum, which decreases within a minute of illumination to a lower steady state. Fluorescence spectroscopy reveals that the fluorescence yield during both processes is primarily modulated on the FMO-protein level, while the emission from chlorosomes remains mostly unchanged. The two most likely candidates that modulate bacteriochlorophyll fluorescence are (1) direct excitation quenching at the FMO-protein level and (2) indirect modulation of FMO-protein fluorescence by the reduction state of electron carriers that are part of the reaction center.

abstract = {In a recent paper, Peter Fisher discussed some of the problems with modelling geographical reality using raster GIS, pointing out that 'the pixel ... is a delusion which may become a snare for the unwary given the way it is treated in most modern software' (Fisher 1997). In my own work on the effect of DTM interpolation errors (Wise 1998, in press) I have encountered many of the snares referred to and I have come to the conclusion that many of them are symptomatic of deficiencies in the data modelling facilities provided by current GIS. The purpose of this editorial is to provoke discussion of some of these issues. Goodchild (1992) states that 'a GIS will only be successful if it can present the user with an accurate view of the world; to do so requires ... the use of accurate data models'. The process of constructing a database can be seen as a sequence of data modelling steps, each moving further towards the representation of the phenomena of interest in computer form. Worboys (1995) describes this sequence of data models as follows: - Application Domain Model-a representation of the system of interest in a form comprehensible to people familiar with the system. -Conceptual Computational Model-a representation of the application domain model in a form which is inherently computable, but which is not tied to any particular software or hardware. Since computers can only represent discrete items of information, the Application Domain Model must be represented in terms of discrete entities. -Logical Computational Model-a representation of the Conceptual Computational Model according to a particular type of computer software. -Physical Computational Model-the implementation of the logical computational model on a particular type of computer hardware. In the database field there are a number of well established methodologies for building a database by constructing a similar series of models (Eva 1994, Oracle 1998). The advantage of this approach is that the models provides users with an appropriate view of the database, with technical details of lower level models hidden from them. My argument is that this sort of modelling is poorly implemented in current GIS, leading to problems for GIS users. Part of the problem is that there is a lack of agreement in the GIS literature about what the stages of data modelling are. Much of the literature refers to a scheme described in Peuquet (1984) in which there are only three stages-data model, data structure and file structure (DeMers 1997, Heywood et al. 1998) with the two main GIS models-vector and raster- equating with the Conceptual Computational Model in the Worboys scheme. However, the vector and raster data models as implemented in current GIS software are not truly Conceptual models, but are to some extent Logical models, a fact which has been pointed out by others (Goodchild 1992, Jones 1997). To illustrate why this is a problem I will concentrate initially on the Raster model.},

In addition, children spend more time outside, where the concentrations of pollution from traffic, powerplants, and other combustion sources are generally higher. Al- though air pollution has long been thought to exacerbate minor acute illnesses, recent studies have suggested that air pollution, particularly traffic-related pollution, is as- sociated with infant mortality and the development of asthma and atopy. Other studies have associated partic- ulate air pollution with acute bronchitis in children and demonstrated that rates of bronchitis and chronic cough declined in areas where particle concentrations have fallen. More mixed results have been reported for lung function. Overall, evidence for effects of air pollution on children have been growing, and effects are seen at con- centrations that are common today.

abstract = {In the paper, we analysed the impact of proximity to urban green areas on apartment prices in Warsaw. The data-set contained in 43 075 geo-coded apartment transactions for the years 2010 to 2015. In this research, the hedonic method was used in Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Weighted Least Squares (WLS) and Median Quantile Regression (Median QR) models. We found substantial evidence that proximity to an urban green area is positively linked with apartment prices. On an average presence of a green area within 100 meters from an apartment increases the price of a dwelling by 2,8{\%} to 3,1{\%}. The effect of park/forest proximity on house prices is more significant for newer apartments than those built before 1989. We found that proximity to a park or a forest is particularly important (and has a higher implicit price as a result) in the case of buildings constructed after 1989. The impact of an urban green was particularly high in the case of a post-transformation housing estate. Close vicinity (less than 100 m distance) to an urban green increased the sales prices of apartments in new residential buildings by 8,0–8,6{\%}, depending on a model.},

abstract = {Information visualization is an interdisciplinary research area in which cartographic efforts have mostly addressed the handling of geographic information. Some cartographers have recently become involved in attempts to extend geographic principles and cartographic techniques to the visualization of non-geographic information. This paper reports on current progress and future opportunities in this emerging research field commonly known as spatialization. The discussion is mainly devoted to the computational techniques that turn high-dimensional data into visualizations via processes of projection and transformation. It is argued that cartographically informed engagement of computationally intensive techniques can help to provide richer and less apaque information visualizations. The discussion of spatialization methods is linked to another priority area of cartographic involvement, the development of theory and principles for cognitively plausible spatialization. The paper distinguishes two equally important sets of challenges for cartographic success in spatialization research. One is the recognition that there are distinct advantages to applying a cartographic perspective in information visualization. This requires our community to more thoroughly understand the essence of cartographic activity and to explore the implications of its metaphoric transfer to non-geographic domains. Another challenge lies in cartographers becoming a more integral part of the information visualization community and actively engaging its constituent research fields.},

One of the perplexing aspects to asthma is that the prevalence is increasing in most industrialized countries. The reasons for this widespread increase are largely unknown. Another aspect of industrialization is the persistence of air pollution in urban areas. Because much air pollution is due to vehicles, no solution appears in sight. The topic of this article is the association between air pollution and various signs and symptoms of asthma. Air pollution is convincingly associated with many signs of asthma aggravation. These include pulmonary function decrements, increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness, visits to emergency departments, hospital admissions, increased medication use and symptom reporting, inflammatory changes, interactions between air pollution and allergen challenges, and immune system changes. With the exception of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, common air pollutants have not been shown to cause asthma. It seems prudent for clinicians to counsel their patients about the potential risks of asthma aggravation from common outdoor air pollutants.},

Both processes are described by many existing models and experiments, on-site and in wind tunnels, focussing e.g. on urban street canyons and crossings or vegetation barriers adjacent to traffic sources. There is an urgent need for well-structured experimental data, including detailed empirical descriptions of parameters that are not the explicit focus of the study.This review revealed that design and choice of urban vegetation is crucial when using vegetation as an ecosystem service for air quality improvements. The reduced mixing in trafficked street canyons on adding large trees increases local air pollution levels, while low vegetation close to sources can improve air quality by increasing deposition. Filtration vegetation barriers have to be dense enough to offer large deposition surface area and porous enough to allow penetration, instead of deflection of the air stream above the barrier. The choice between tall or short and dense or sparse vegetation determines the effect on air pollution from different sources and different particle sizes.},

One such non-market benefit is the reduction in air pollution, linked to health impacts (mortality and morbidity). This study assesses the benefits Of SO2 and PM'10 absorption by trees in terms of extending life expectancy of the population and reducing hospital admissions. Working at a resolution of 1 km2 With woodland over 2 ha, it is estimated that, for Britain as a whole, woodland saves between 5 and 7 deaths, that would otherwise have been brought forward, and between 4 and 6 hospital admissions each year. The economic value of the health effect of woodland is estimated to be at least {\pounds}900,000 per year. Smaller areas of woodland, often located closer to population, sometimes strategically planted close to pollution sources, will generate additional air pollution absorption benefits to those estimated here. Researching such benefits would require more detailed data than is available at present for a national study. However, the health benefits of woodland are relatively small in comparison to other non-market forestry benefits. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The burden of automobile dependence is one of London's most intractable problems, yet the capital's urban fabric remains inherently car orientated. Planning and Urban Design mechanisms have a seemingly decisive role in the quest to alleviate the supremacy of cars, however their contribution is frequently undervalued and under researched, particularly in the context of rational objectives within tangible localities. This thesis therefore adopts a cross case analysis involving six naturalistic case study neighbourhoods and seeks to elucidate the influence of the pedestrian environment upon the perception and behaviour of users and hence the potential role of pedestrian orientated planning and design in reducing the need to travel by car. The investigation also endeavours to determine whether public demand for enhanced pedestrian provision exists within London and embraces issues relating to the composition and configuration of successful pedestrian orientated neighbourhoods. The thesis provides compelling evidence that the quality of the pedestrian environment influences use levels, intrinsic behaviour and travel preferences during periods when pedestrians are engaged in unconstrained activity. Consequently, it is concluded that superior pedestrian provision can appreciably contribute to the alleviation of automobile dependence within London. However, there is no evidence of universal public consensus supporting an enhanced pedestrian realm throughout London, although the interview survey revealed fervent calls for improvements at the neighbourhood scale. The investigation also suggests that qualities of compactness and heterogeneity are integral attributes of a successful pedestrian orientated neighbourhood as are certain designable facets; notably a provision for personal wellbeing, unimpeded movement and a unique identity. It is concluded that the concentric neighbourhood model can reconcile these attributes, though should not be slavishly adhered to and must enable flexible, neighbourhood specific adaptations. However, it is proposed that a more progressive political standpoint is also required before pedestrian orientated neighbourhoods can be delivered throughout London.},

abstract = {Rationale: Few studies have examined associations between longterm exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and lung function decline in adults. Objectives: To determine if exposure to traffic and PM2.5 is associated with longitudinal changes in lung function in a population-based cohort in the Northeastern United States, where pollution levels are relatively low. Methods: FEV1 and FVC were measured up to two times between 1995 and 2011 among 6,339 participants of the Framingham Offspring or Third Generation studies. We tested associations between residential proximity to a major roadway and PM2.5 exposure in 2001 (estimated by a land-use model using satellite measurements of aerosol optical thickness) and lung function. We examined differences in average lung function using mixed-effects models and differences in lung function decline using linear regression models. Current smokers were excluded. Models were adjusted for age, sex, height, weight, pack-years, socioeconomic status indicators, cohort, time, season, and weather. Measurements and Main Results: Living less than 100 m from a major roadway was associated with a 23.2 ml (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], -44.4 to -1.9) lower FEV1 and a 5.0 ml/yr (95{\%} CI, -9.0 to -0.9) faster decline in FEV1 compared with more than 400 m. Each 2 $\mu$g/m3 increase in average of PM2.5 was associated with a 13.5 ml (95{\%} CI, -26.6 to -0.3) lower FEV1 and a 2.1 ml/yr (95{\%} CI, -4.1 to -0.2) faster decline in FEV1 There were similar associations with FVC. Associations with FEV1/FVC ratio were weak or absent. Conclusions: Long-term exposure to traffic and PM2.5, at relatively low levels, was associated with lower FEV1 and FVC and an accelerated rate of lung function decline.},

abstract = {Background Dementia is a devastating condition typically preceded by a long prodromal phase characterized by accumulation of neuropathology and accelerated cognitive decline. A growing number of epidemiologic studies have explored the relation between air pollution exposure and dementia-related outcomes. Methods We undertook a systematic review, including quality assessment, to interpret the collective findings and describe methodological challenges that may limit study validity. Articles, which were identified according to a registered protocol, had to quantify the association of an air pollution exposure with cognitive function, cognitive decline, a dementia-related neuroimaging feature, or dementia. Results We identified 18 eligible published articles. The quality of most studies was adequate to exemplary. Almost all reported an adverse association between at least one pollutant and one dementia-related outcome. However, relatively few studies considered outcomes that provide the strongest evidence for a causal effect, such as within-person cognitive or pathologic changes. Reassuringly, differential selection would likely bias toward a protective association in most studies, making it unlikely to account for observed adverse associations. Likewise, using a formal sensitivity analysis, we found that unmeasured confounding is also unlikely to explain reported adverse associations. Discussion We also identified several common challenges. First, most studies of incident dementia identified cases from health system records. As dementia in the community is underdiagnosed, this could generate either non-differential or differential misclassification bias. Second, almost all studies used recent air pollution exposures as surrogate measures of long-term exposure. Although this approach may be reasonable if the measured and etiologic exposure windows are separated by a few years, its validity is unknown over longer intervals. Third, comparing the magnitude of associations may not clearly pinpoint which, if any, pollutants are the probable causal agents, because the degree of exposure misclassification differs across pollutants. The epidemiologic evidence, alongside evidence from other lines of research, provides support for a relation of air pollution exposure to dementia. Future studies with improved design, analysis and reporting would fill key evidentiary gaps and provide a solid foundation for recommendations and possible interventions.},

We consider the role of local amenities and disamenities in generating price variation within urban areas, focusing on three highly policy-relevant urban issues-transport accessibility, school quality, and crime. Our survey of the recent empirical literature highlights what is known and what is not known on these issues, and considers the relevance and reliability of this evidence for policy design and evaluation. Although there are serious empirical challenges, we argue that research on housing values based on careful research designs can offer credible estimates of the social value of place-specific attributes and amenities. {\textcopyright} The Authors 2008.

@article{Cao2018,
abstract = {This paper investigates the combined problem of high car dependence and housing affordability, in view of likely continued volatility in oil prices (and hence higher petrol and diesel prices), and rising house prices. Household budgets are likely to be stretched where there are high levels of car dependency and housing unaffordability – with little flexibility for rising costs in either or both of these. A composite car dependence and housing affordability (CDHA) index is developed, using indices of oil vulnerability related to car travel and housing affordability. Greater London is used as the case study, with 2001 and 2011 data analysed at the level of Lower Super Output Areas, and presented using Geographic Information System and R statistical software. The findings reveal that there are high levels of composite car dependence and housing price vulnerability in many suburban areas across Greater London, adding to the previous areas of social deprivation found mainly in East London. The composite CDHA index illustrates where the most vulnerable areas are spatially. Many neighbourhoods may become less attractive for those on median or even relatively high incomes. The areas most affected may become much more expensive to live in, potentially leading to much greater pressure on travel and housing costs as people could be forced to live further from the centre of London, including beyond the Greater London boundary, which has further implications for travel. Failing to consider these emerging affordability issues represents an oversight in terms of transport planning in London.},

After adjustment for other factors, an association remained between ambient annual average concentrations of fine particles (represented by PM2.5)1 and age-specific risks of mortality, implying shorter life expectancy in more polluted cities. In its 1998 report (Department of Health, 1998), the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (COMEAP) did not recommend that these studies should be used as a basis for quantifying the effects on health of long-term exposure to particulate air pollution in the UK. However, it was noted that, had these studies been used, the assessment of the overall impacts of particulate air pollution would have been considerably increased.},

abstract = {There is increasing concern for the affordability of daily mobility costs, notably by car. In this paper, we use the term 'car-related economic stress' (CRES) to refer to households spending a disproportionate amount of money on car travel. We propose two indicators to investigate CRES in Great Britain, both of which are based on widely available, continuous surveys. First, a 'Low-Income-High-Costs' metric, inspired by the UK government indicator of fuel poverty, and applied to the Living Costs and Food Survey. We complement this with the analysis of a material deprivation-based measure of CRES, based on the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions. Our analysis suggests that, in 2012, CRES affected between 6.7{\%} and 9{\%} of households in Great Britain, corresponding to between 1.7 and 2.3 million households. Low population density and difficult access to public transport are associated with a higher risk of CRES. In terms of social profile, households at risk of CRES are not so different from the average of the population, but are clearly distinct from low income households with low motoring costs and from households who cannot afford cars. Our analysis identifies a number of socio-economic factors (household size, presence of children, underemployment, disability) which may increase the ratio between car travel needs and household income, thus increasing the risk of economic stress. 1. Introduction Rapidly fluctuating oil prices, stagnating real incomes and increasing car ownership among low-income groups have drawn increasing attention to questions of affordability in transport. In developed countries, research has focused mostly on households who need (or might need) to spend a disproportionate amount of money on car-based mobility in order to access essential services and opportunities. In this paper, we refer to this phenomenon as 'car-related economic stress' (CRES) (Mattioli {\&} Colleoni, 2015). We propose two indicators to investigate CRES in Great Britain, both of which are based on widely available, continuous surveys. The first indicator is applied to the ONS Living Costs and Food Survey (LCFS), and is inspired by the current official UK government indicator of (domestic) fuel poverty. It defines households at risk of CRES as those with low income and high motoring costs. The second indicator is applied to the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC). It defines households at risk of CRES as those who own a car despite being 'materially deprived'. Our goals are: (i) to quantify the incidence of CRES in Great Britain; (ii) to identify the distinguishing features, both spatial and socio-economic, of households at risk of CRES. The paper is structured as follows: in Section 2, we briefly review previous research on CRES and identify research gaps. In Section 3, we offer a critique of previous metrics of transport affordability proposed in the British context. Sections 4 and 5 present the indicators and the research findings, which are then discussed in Section 6.},

abstract = {Background: Previous studies have shown associations between air pollution and risk for lung cancer. Ob jective: We investigated whether traffic and the concentration of nitrogen oxides (NOx) at the residence are associated with risk for lung cancer. Methods: We identified 592 lung cancer cases in the Danish Cancer Registry among 52,970 members of the Diet, Cancer and Health cohort and traced residential addresses from 1 January 1971 in the Central Population Registry. We calculated the NOx concentration at each address by dispersion models and calculated the time-weighted average concentration for all addresses for each person. We used Cox models to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) after adjustment for smoking (status, duration, and intensity), environmental tobacco smoke, length of school attendance, occupation, and dietary intake of fruit. Results: For the highest compared with the lowest quartile of NOx concentration at the residence, we found an IRR for lung cancer of 1.30 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 1.05-1.61], and the IRR for lung cancer in association with living within 50 m of a major road ({\textgreater} 10,000 vehicles/day) was 1.21 (95{\%} CI, 0.95-1.55). The results showed tendencies of stronger associations among nonsmokers, among those with a relatively low fruit intake, and among those with a longer school attendance; only length of school attendance modified the effect significantly. Conclusions: This study supports that risk for lung cancer is associated with different markers of air pollution from traffic near the residence.},

abstract = {Foreword In the past decades a large number of studies have indicated the presence of various chemical compounds in indoor environments (buildings, homes). The presence of these chemicals in indoor air is the result of infiltration of polluted outdoor air and of emissions from various indoor sources, including building materials, activities of the occupants, consumer products, smoking etc. For many of these chemicals, the impact on human health and comfort is almost totally unknown and difficult to predict because of the lack of toxicological data and of information on the dose-response characteristics in humans or animal models. On the other hand, a full toxicological testing as requested by the " existing chemicals " legislation is difficult to accomplish for these compounds, because it would involve the investigation of acute and sub-acute toxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity according to testing protocols that are complex, time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, the EU policy on limitation of unnecessary animal testing further limits the possibility of advocating a generalized animal testing of these chemicals.},

Air pollutants are hypothesized to exert their effects via impaired endothelial function, elevated systemic inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress, all of which are hallmarks of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here we review epidemiological studies aimed at answering whether diabetes patients are more vulnerable to ambient (outdoor) air pollution exposure and whether air pollution is associated with diabetes development or other predisposing conditions for T2D. Current evidence suggests an association between air pollution exposure and T2D, but more critical analysis is warranted. Understanding the associations between air pollution exposure and the development of T2D is critical in our efforts to control sources of air pollution and their impact on the disease.},
