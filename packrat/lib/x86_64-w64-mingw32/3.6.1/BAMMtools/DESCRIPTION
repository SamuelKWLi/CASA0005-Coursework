Description: Provides functions for analyzing and visualizing complex
    macroevolutionary dynamics on phylogenetic trees. It is a companion
    package to the command line program BAMM (Bayesian Analysis of
    Macroevolutionary Mixtures) and is entirely oriented towards the
    analysis, interpretation, and visualization of evolutionary rates.
    Functionality includes visualization of rate shifts on phylogenies,
    estimating evolutionary rates through time, comparing posterior
    distributions of evolutionary rates across clades, comparing
    diversification models using Bayes factors, and more.
